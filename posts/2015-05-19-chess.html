<h1>Chess</h1>
<p class="date">May 19, 2015</p>
<p>Okay, so chess isn’t going to take a week. I started working on it yesterday, and despite not having much time for it today, I’m already getting pretty close. I’ve got my board class and piece class mostly setup and I’m beginning on my game class now, so I should have it finished tomorrow if all goes well.</p>
<p>Chess is really interesting/fun! I’ve made a point of not cheating off anyone else’s code, so that I can be sure that I’m ready for Rails. Then again, I did install a neat gem called Colored, that just helps me color a given string in the command line. I could have done that on my own, but it looked a little tedious, plus gems are still part of the whole thing anyway, maaaaann.</p>
<p>Oh, and I also caught myself up on Git and all of it’s features. It’s still got a lot of mystical-seeming functionality, but I’ve got a much better understanding of what it’s doing, and why it’s important, so I’m happy with my bare-bones knowledge for now.</p>
<p>That’s about it!</p>
